## ‚ú® Creating a Visual Demo

A short video or GIF is the best way to show off your app.

1.  **Record your screen:** Use your phone's screen recorder or an emulator to record a 30-60 second video of you using the app's main features.
2.  **Convert to GIF:** Use a free online tool like [Ezgif](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif) to convert your video into a high-quality GIF.
3.  **Upload to GitHub:** Add the GIF to your repository and update the link at the top of this README.



By filling this out, you will have a professional-looking README that clearly explains what your app does, how it's built, and how others can use it. This will make a huge difference to anyone (like a recruiter) visiting your GitHub profile.
